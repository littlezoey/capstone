Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services

Background
Arvato Financial Services is a mail-order sales company in Germany, the end goal of this project is to help the company use a data-driven instead of rule-based approach to identify the potential customers and target them in the company's marketing exercise. 
The problem can be solved because the historical demographics data for customers are given, we can use the data to train an unsurpervised model, which can be used to predict the likelihood of potential customers for a general population.
